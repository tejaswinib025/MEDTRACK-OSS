## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/R3ACTR/MEDTRACK-OSS.git
cd MEDTRACK-OSS/mobile_app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required Flutter packages:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

This command reads the `pubspec.yaml` file and downloads all dependencies.

### 3. Verify Flutter Installation

Check that Flutter is properly configured:
```bash
flutter doctor
```

This will show you any missing dependencies or configuration issues. Follow the recommendations to resolve them.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `mobile_app` directory (if not already present):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with your configuration:
```env
# Backend API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
API_TIMEOUT=30000

# Environment (development/staging/production)
ENVIRONMENT=development

# Optional: Push Notification Keys
FCM_SERVER_KEY=your_firebase_server_key_here
```

### 5. Platform-Specific Setup

#### Android Setup

1. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and verify `minSdkVersion` is set to 21 or higher
2. If using Firebase, place `google-services.json` in `android/app/`

#### iOS Setup (macOS only)

1. Navigate to iOS directory:
```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   cd ..
```
2. If using Firebase, place `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `ios/Runner/`

### Key Directories Explained

- **lib/models/**: Contains data classes representing medications, users, schedules, etc.
- **lib/screens/**: Full-page widgets (e.g., Login, Dashboard, Medication List)
- **lib/services/**: Backend communication, local storage, and notifications
- **lib/providers/**: State management using Provider or Riverpod pattern
- **lib/widgets/**: Reusable components like custom buttons, cards, and forms

## Backend Connection

The mobile app communicates with the MedTrack FastAPI backend. Here's how it's configured:

### API Service Configuration

The app uses `lib/services/api_service.dart` to handle all HTTP requests. Key endpoints include:
```dart
// Example API endpoints
POST   /api/auth/login          # User authentication
GET    /api/medications         # Fetch user's medications
POST   /api/medications         # Add new medication
PUT    /api/medications/{id}    # Update medication
DELETE /api/medications/{id}    # Delete medication
GET    /api/reminders           # Fetch reminders
POST   /api/adherence           # Log medication intake
```

### Connecting to Backend

1. **Local Development**: 
   - Ensure the backend is running (see `backend/README.md`)
   - Default backend URL: `http://localhost:8000`
   - For Android emulator: Use `http://10.0.2.2:8000`
   - For iOS simulator: Use `http://localhost:8000`
   - For physical device: Use your computer's IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8000`)

2. **Update API Base URL**:
   Edit `.env` file:
```env
   API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8000/api  # For Android emulator
   # or
   API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8000/api  # For physical device
```

3. **Testing Backend Connection**:
   The app includes a health check endpoint. On first launch, it will display connectivity status.

### Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials on Login screen
2. App sends POST request to `/api/auth/login`
3. Backend returns JWT token
4. Token is stored securely using `flutter_secure_storage`
5. All subsequent API requests include the token in headers

flutter run --profile

# Run in release mode
flutter run --release
```

#### Hot Reload

While the app is running, press:
- `r` to hot reload (preserves state)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Doctor found issues"
```bash
flutter doctor
```
Follow the instructions to fix any reported issues.

#### 2. Dependency Conflicts
```bash
flutter pub cache repair
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

#### 3. Cannot Connect to Backend

- Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Check firewall settings
- For physical devices, ensure they're on the same network
- Verify `API_BASE_URL` in `.env`

#### 4. Build Errors on iOS
```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter run
```

#### 5. "Gradle Build Failed" (Android)

- Update `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`
- Check `android/build.gradle` for compatible versions
- Ensure Android SDK is up to date
