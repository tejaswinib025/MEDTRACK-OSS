# MedTrack OSS Ethics & Privacy

## 1. Privacy by Design
MedTrack OSS is designed to store the minimum amount of personal data required for operation. Medication data is encrypted at rest.

## 2. Consent
Caregiver monitoring is strictly opt-in. A user must explicitly grant access to their adherence logs to a designated caregiver.

## 3. Not a Medical Device
This software is a reminder system only. It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Users should always follow the advice of their healthcare providers.

## 4. Data Ownership
Users have the right to export or delete their data at any time. We do not sell or share user data with third parties.
